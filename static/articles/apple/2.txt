Apple is sharing your face with apps. That’s a new privacy worry.
By Geoffrey A. Fowler, Washington Post, Nov. 30, 2017
Poop that mimics your facial expressions was just the beginning.
It’s going to hit the fan when the face-mapping tech that powers the iPhone X’s cutesy “Animoji” starts being used for creepier purposes. And Apple just started sharing your face with lots of apps.
 A poop Animoji made possible by the face-mapping tech in the iPhone X that's now available to apps.
Now that a phone can scan your mug, what else might apps want to do with it? They could track your expressions to judge if you’re depressed. They could guess your gender, race and even sexuality. They might combine your face with other data to observe you in stores—or walking down the street.
Apps aren’t doing most of these things, yet. But is Apple doing enough to stop it? After I pressed executives this week, Apple made at least one change—retroactively requiring an app tapping into face data to publish a privacy policy.
“We take privacy and security very seriously,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said. “This commitment is reflected in the strong protections we have built around Face ID data—protecting it with the Secure Enclave in iPhone X—as well as many other technical safeguards we have built into iOS.”
Indeed, Apple—which makes most of its money from selling us hardware, not selling our data—may be our best defense against a coming explosion in facial recognition. But I also think Apple rushed into sharing face maps with app makers that may not share its commitment, and it isn’t being paranoid enough about the minefield it just entered.
“I think we should be quite worried,” said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. “The chances we are going to see mischief around facial data is pretty high—if not today, then soon—if not on Apple then on Android.”
Your face is open for business.
Apple’s face tech sets some good precedents—and some bad ones. It won praise for storing the face data it uses to unlock the iPhone X securely on the phone, instead of sending it to its servers over the Internet.
